# This repo is creation for training LoFTR on custom dataset

This is initial LoFTR [README](docs/README.md) file.

As we all know, training LoFTR is not easy, I mean the official dont offer too much info for training our own custom datasets, so I give it a try.

This repo finishs the following things:

-[ ] Using Colmap for sparse reconstruction.

-[ ] Using Depth-Anything evaluating Depth for each image.
